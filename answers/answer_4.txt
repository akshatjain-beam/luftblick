Question - Outline your ideas and concepts how to implement a query via URL to make the content easily and quickly accessible, and overview pros and cons.

Answer -
To implement a query via URL for easy and quick content access, you can adjust your existing setup to use a GET request with query parameters. Here's a detailed approach:

Implementation Details

1. GET Request:
   - Modify the Flask route to accept GET requests.
   - Use query parameters to specify the keys you want to filter.

2. Accessing Query Parameters:
   - Extract a list of keys from the json body of request.

3. Database Query:
   - Retrieve all relevant database records.
   - Iterate through the records and filter content based on the provided keys.
   - Construct a response that includes matched content for each record.

Code

```python
@app.route("/api/query", methods=["GET"])
def query_calibration_data():
    """
    Query calibration data based on provided keys.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing a JSON response and HTTP status code.
    """
    try:
        keys = request.json
        if not keys or not isinstance(keys, list):
            abort(400, description="Invalid or missing keys in request body")

        query = CalibrationData.query
        results = query.all()

        response = []
        for row in results:
            content = row.get_content()
            matched_content = {key: content.get(key) for key in keys if key in content}
            if matched_content:
                response.append(
                    {"filename": row.filename, "matched_content": matched_content}
                )

        return jsonify(response), 200

    except SQLAlchemyError as e:
        db.session.rollback()
        return jsonify({"error": "Database error", "details": str(e)}), 500
    except Exception as e:
        return (
            jsonify({"error": "An unexpected error occurred", "details": str(e)}),
            500,
        )
```

Pros

- URL Accessibility: Users can directly enter the query in the URL bar of a browser or use it in scripts.
- Caching: GET requests can be cached by browsers and proxies, reducing load times and server load.
- Statelessness: Each request contains all the necessary information, enhancing scalability.

Cons

- Security Risks: Sensitive information should not be included in URLs as they can be logged or cached.
- Encoding Required: Special characters in keys need to be URL-encoded, which can be cumbersome.
